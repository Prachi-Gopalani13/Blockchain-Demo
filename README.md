## Blockchain Breif
As the name suggests, A Blockchain is a “chain of Blocks”. Each block contains a “Block Number”, “Nonce”, “Information (data)” where particular transaction takes place, “Previous Hash” and, “hash”.

All the Blocks in the Blockchain are linked to each other with the “hash” variable. A “hash” contains information of the previous block in the chain and that’s what keeps the entire chain-linked and connected. This hash is nothing but some keys which are some shuffled characters made from cryptographic algorithms (such as: SHA256, SHA512, SHA6 etc.)
Let’s take SH256 Alogorithm: contains 64 Characters (1, 2….9,0 &A, B, C, …. E, F) and 256 bits (4X64) each character.
